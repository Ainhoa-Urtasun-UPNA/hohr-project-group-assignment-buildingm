## Task 1
* Objective: analyze your industry and decide your primary and support activities.
Every architectural project needs a concept model that helps architects and clients to visualize the idea. 3D printers for architectural models are becoming more and more common in cutting-edge studios all over the world. Models are the most realistic and approximate expression of what a building will look like once it is built. The viewer can guess and have a preview of what the building to be constructed will resemble. It is possible to visualize the lines, the volumes and the relationship with the space that the building will have.

Our company’s core business is to create personalized models adapted to multiple industries. For instance, we have composed various models for real estate agencies and developers, allowing the public to see what they are buying before it is built. Furthermore, we have reproduced some of the biggest architectural pieces around Spain, including the “Guggenheim Museum” in Bilbao and “La Sagrada Familia” in Barcelona. The former allowed the builders of the basilica to try the different details before including them in real life which has notably improved the final result. 

BuildingM can turn any idea, large or small, simple or complex, into a reality. We can manufacture any type of design, from prototyping to large-scale production. We now have the power to customize like never before and also to produce your product when and where you need it - from prototyping to full-scale production. BuildingM will help you open new markets and develop new applications, upgrading your business to a whole new level.

## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.
***
During the very first year we were 4 people in total working in the company, in fact, we were 2 managers, 1 engineer and 1 operator. After several staff movements, we can conclude that the expected number of available workers one year from now will be 1 manager, 1 engineer and 2 operators. 

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.
***
RESULTS:
4'333333
12'45833
7'041666
We expect to demand 4 managers, 12 engineers and 7 operators in a year from now and we had  1 manager, 1 engineer and 2 operators.
In this case, we have a shortage of 3 managers, 11 engineers and 5 operators.
## Task 5
